As a service developer, I want to be able to host it as a windows service or as a command line app.

As a windows service developper I do not want to be bothered with details

As a developper I want to be able to install/uninstall the service easily

As an installer, I expect the system to assist me filling the proper information:
  - service details: executable, arguments, directory, name

As an operational manager, I expect to define shon packaging and to be able to update it whenever I think it is needed.

As an operational architect I want to control where the service is deployed and run.
As an operational architect I want to couple the service to the IS description

As a service developper I want to build a package that has little to none coupling to the deployement site
